                An avid technologist, I grew up with a natural curiosity towards technology. My parents often found me dissasembling some piece of machinery or electronics. That inclination towards tech stayed with me as I grew and I found myself gravitating more and more towards software. After serving in the US Marines, I traveled up to beautiful Seattle to attend Code Fellows and here I am.
